# Maze Solving App
A simple maze solving app made in python

This app draws and solves a maze according to the specified grid size and cell size. 
Currently doesn't implement any algorithm to speed up the process and has a hard limit on how many rows and columns it can have as it uses recursion and python has a default limit of 999 recursions

This project was made with the help of [Boot.Dev]

This is my first "completed" project to date so it's really not much
